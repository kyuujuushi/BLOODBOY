					<h1>About</h1>
                    <p>Hello! This website is made to host a webcomic called "BLOOD BOY".</p>
                    <p>
                        BLOOD BOY is a horror webcomic split up into many short stories to tell the plot across different points of time, perspectives and timelines 
                        <i>ye you read that right, timelines</i>. Now, why would it be in multiple timelines? Because 1) there is an alien race that fucks around with
                        timelines and 2) bc I was writing one version of this story and the new version wouldn't make too much sense so I thought LETS RECYCLE THE OLD DRAFT!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now, don't worry about the timeline mess I'll make a webpage that has the whole diagram of the chaos the timeline tree is later but there is one thing you 
                        <strong>DO</strong> need to know about the timelines and how they work:
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            The timelines are grouped into three main groups:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Group ALPHA</li>
                                <li>Group BETA</li>
                                <li>Group GAMMA</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Group ALPHA is the group of timelines that sets up the playing field of the story. The backstory if you will. 
                            Things like "Why is Zaccharie in a roadtrip with a random not-actually-hackers?", "How the hell did Jason get his blood powers to become 'The Blood Boy'?"
                            stuff like that.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Group BETA is the group of timelines where Zaccharie didn't go to the roadtrip with the not-actually-hackers and instead had a normal life until Jason somehow
                            comes back to Boston and THEN Zaccharie gets involved with The GHOSTs. This group's focus is only that Zaccharie is the person that yeets Lilith from reality itself,
                            dies bc he basically made a "black hole" <i>no it isn't a black hole but there isn't air in the void anyways so it does suck like a black hole</i> which is the
                            reason why group GAMMA exists in the first place.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Group GAMMA is the group of timelines where at least one of them ends in a happy ending and our main characters just die of the good ol' old age (except Jason, 
                            he dies from the sun being too old and starts fucking expanding) and it all starts with Zaccharie being all "Imma save my childhood friend from an evil biotech company!
                            It's not <i>thaaat</i> bad to do that right? Right? No one gonna die right?"
                        </li>
                    </ol>
