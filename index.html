    <title>Index Redirect</title>

    <!-- 
        This file is here for the purposes to redirect to whatever comic
        story I need to change it to instead of having index being an intro
        to it, I want the viewer be immediatly shown the comic (which is why
        the nav bar is at the side)

        the location will be updated once I'm finished with the css for the site
        (at least the desktop version bc i'm working kinda backwards) and the frist
        story I've decided to work on (which rn is gonna be the Steven story).
        
        DESKTOP CSS CODE AND THE FIRST STORY IS WHEN THIS WILL BE UPDATED! pls be patient
        ;-;
